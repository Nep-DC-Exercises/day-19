# Fetch, Promises, DOM

### Date: 9/24/19

### Summary

We modified the chuck norris assignment from yesterday and then used some of the techniques learned to continue working on the weather app. Below is a summary:

1. Refactored yesterdays code
2. Utilized two different endpoints on the same API
3. Dynamically populated the DOM
4. Incorporated CSS Framework

I'm finding it really interesting learning javascript and how it can asynchronously fetch data without blocking the browser. It's been easier understanding the fetch/promise syntax after struggling with writing it compared to reading about it.
